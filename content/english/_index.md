# Hello! :wave: and Welcome.

This is the Minimalistic website that I built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the template [Anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole), because I'm a BackEnd Software Engineer, not a FrontEnd or Designer type of person :laughing: . This site is intended only to show off a little bit of myself and to increase my online footPrint.

Here you'll find some tips and maybe some answers to your daily developer problems because I'll post some tips & tricks, personal knowledge and more, so, stay tuned. :rocket:
<!--
This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome

- Hugo :rocket:
- Hugo theme :rocket:

Don't forget to check the README.md file!
```

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.
