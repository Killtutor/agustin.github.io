I'm a self-learner, adventurer and All-Roads type of person, who loves to be challenged with problems to be solved and to help in finding and fixing problems.
I'm happy being in a team as so in solo missions, I've got the opportunity to work with AWS environment as so with GCP environment, working with cloud tools to build cloud solutions that were/are deployed right now. It's been 4 years since I join the software workforce, and focus on my code skills and knowledge to be able to build enterprise and real-life solutions

Here are my principal and most practiced software tools:

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GCP enviroment](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Bash Scripts](https://devhints.io/bash)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
- [AWS Enviroment](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)

Obviously, I just know a little bit more than Jhon Snow, but hey! with this blog I'm just trying to help and share my knowledge :-) I hope you can enjoy it.
