I'm a self learner, adventurer, All-Roads type of person, who loves to be challenged with problems to be solved and to help in finding and fixing problems.
I'm happy being in a team as so in solo missions, I've the opportunity to work with AWS enviroment as so with GCP enviroment, working with cloud tools to build cloud solutions that were/are deployed wight now. It's been 4 years since I join the software workforce, and focus on my code skills and knowledge to be able to build enterprise and real life solutions

Here are my principal and most practiced software tools:

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GCP enviroment](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Bash Scripts](https://devhints.io/bash)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
- [AWS Enviroment](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)

Obviusly I just know a little bit more that Jhon Snow, but hey! with this blog I'm just trying to help and share my knowledge :-) I hope you can enjoy it.
