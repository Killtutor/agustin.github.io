# I'm Super Excited :metal:

You can't imagine how excited I am to have my own website, I can finally share my thoughts and knowledge to show off my skills and that I'm not a fraud :laughing: .
Believed it or not, that's what I thought about myself when I seek at my online footprint, online career and collaborations to found mostly nothing, nothing helpful to a company HR personnel to determine: "Hey! This guy knows how to code, let's hire him up".

# Why a personal website is important? üïµüèΩ

Well, A personal website is not always needed, maybe your collaborations and code writing can be publicly accessible as at a public repo will be, but if you(my friend) are just like me, and had only worked for private companies/startups you have 0 lines of code to share to a possible headhunter that's looking for your experience stack, why? Because almost every private company wants to hide their app code from the public, and so do your code collabs. No need to say that if you are a Backend developer or a cloud infrastructure maintainer/designer maybe your work exposure is even worse, so, stop losing more time watching Instagram, keep out of your comfort zone and start to type your website and share your work to the world.

# Wanna know how I did it? :smirk:

First, you have to know yourself to use the tech stack you are most comfy with, in my case, I didn't want to spend time designing or writing HTML, CSS code, looking for some service to pay to host my website, so I started in my daily used git platform (Gitlab) were I found that they offer Pages, a service to publish your static web content to the web for Free :wink: looking for some static web content frameworks I did find Hugo, and looking at their templates I find the one that most approach to my love in simplicity and classic style, Anatole. So I install Hugo and learn how to config my new project to use the Anatole theme and voila! I can run my website in my local and update as needed as fast as a blink of an eye, but I didn't want to configure a Gitlab CI/CD to publish my site, and Github offers some similar service, so I publish my code in Github which allows me to separate my work environment(Gitlab) and my personal environment(Github)

# Do you want the step-by-step guide?
Just let me know, email me your request, I'll be happy to build the guide for you in another post.
